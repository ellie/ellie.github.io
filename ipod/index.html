Thank you so much for your interest in my work &lt;3</p></blockquote><p>I shared this on Twitter recently, and have had a bunch of people ask me for more details - so here they are!</p><p>Just a heads up that this is pretty image-heavy, in case you&rsquo;re on a limited data plan.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been the sort of person who struggles to do <em>anything</em> without some sort of music going on in the background. A long time ago this was with a little mp3 player, then an iPod, and eventually on to a phone with Spotify.</p><p>I realised something not so long ago - I was being very lazy. I&rsquo;d often just play my weekly/daily mix, or some playlist I made up a long time ago. I&rsquo;d never really <strong>think</strong> about what music I liked + what music I wanted to listen to. I think this is in part due to the fact that almost any music was available - which made choosing even more difficult.</p><p>Anyway. Over the weekend I took apart a 5.5th gen iPod Classic (or iPod Video) and made it suit 2022 a little better :D</p><p>I won&rsquo;t be detailing precisely how I did it. I mostly followed <a href=https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPod_5th_Generation_%28Video%29>iFixit</a>, and fumbled my way through the rest. Almost all of the cables can be removed by lifting a little black lever, and are equally as easy to replace. I&rsquo;d recommend ordering some iPod tools :)</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1472.jpeg alt="Example connections, can you spot the little lever?"><figcaption><p>Example connections, can you spot the little lever?</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=the-ipod>The iPod<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-ipod>¶</a></h2><p>I went with a 5.5 for a few reasons. Firstly, the front is plastic. I was going to be replacing the front anyway, so it might as well be easy to open!</p><p>Secondly, and most importantly - the DAC. This generation of iPod was the last to feature the &ldquo;wolfson DAC&rdquo;, which is very well known for being <a href=https://www.macintoshhowto.com/ipod/which-ipod-has-the-best-audio-quality.html/2>of fantastic quality</a>.</p><p>Something else to be aware of is that different models of this iPod had different amounts of memory. The 80GB has 64mb of memory, while smaller capacities have only 32mb. I went with the 80GB :)</p><h3 id=the-components>The components<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-components>¶</a></h3><p>I ordered a bunch of components for this, as I knew pretty much exactly what I wanted. The vast majority of them were found on eBay, where there is a LOT of choice. If there&rsquo;s anything specific, I&rsquo;ll link it</p><h3 id=opening>Opening<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#opening>¶</a></h3><p>Opening the iPod was made fairly simple with the iPod tools. After working my way around the casing, it just popped open. iFixit had good instructions there!</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1467.jpeg alt="Two halfs of the iPod, perhaps not opened for 16 years?"><figcaption><p>Two halfs of the iPod, perhaps not opened for 16 years?</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id=storage>Storage<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#storage>¶</a></h3><p>First and foremost, storage. 80GB is definitely not enough for what I want. The original iPod also used a HDD - ideally I&rsquo;d be swapping this out for something solid state.</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/camphoto_1483920592.jpg alt="The old HDD, look how big it is! It was surrounded in rubber vibration-dampening stuff"><figcaption><p>The old HDD, look how big it is! It was surrounded in rubber vibration-dampening stuff</p></figcaption></figure><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of choice here, but I went with an <a href=https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-quad/>iFlash Quad</a>. This lets you use up to four SD cards! There&rsquo;s no real performance difference here compared to other storage options, as it&rsquo;s pretty limited regardless. In addition, SD cards use less power + put out less heat than the comparable SSDs.</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1483.jpeg alt="The iFlash, complete with 2x512GB SD cards"><figcaption><p>The iFlash, complete with 2x512GB SD cards</p></figcaption></figure><p>This is also thinner than the HDD, allowing you to fit a larger battery or other mods into the chassis.</p><p>Something to be aware of is that the original iPod firmware can struggle with the larger capacity drives, so you will probably need something like <a href=https://www.rockbox.org/>Rockbox</a>. Bear in mind that Rockbox can have issues with the iFlash hardware, so you may need to run a daily build (or transfer your music <a href=https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/Main/IpodFAQ#How_do_I_start_the_original_Apple_Firmware_63>while booted into the original firmware</a>)</p><h3 id=battery>Battery<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#battery>¶</a></h3><p>You can find a LOT of batteries on eBay and other places online, so I won&rsquo;t really say much about that here. I went with a 3000mah :)</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1481.jpeg alt="The old battery! It&amp;rsquo;s pretty small."><figcaption><p>The old battery! It&rsquo;s pretty small.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The battery is one of the first things you need to unplug, as otherwise you can&rsquo;t fully open the iPod. Attemping to open without unplugging will result in broken cables!</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1465.jpeg alt="The battery cable, plugged in"><figcaption><p>The battery cable, plugged in</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id=front-casing>Front casing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#front-casing>¶</a></h3><p>I bought a clear front casing for mine, as I like seeing the guts of my gadgets! Installing this was more fiddly than I expected. Once taken apart, there were six super tiny screws along the edge of the chassis that needed removing. From there, the front comes off - the iPod scroll wheel is actually just resting in place. So if you&rsquo;re not careful, it kinda flops about! As does the display</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1477.jpeg alt="The front casing, separated from the frame. You can see the tiny screw holes there"><figcaption><p>The front casing, separated from the frame. You can see the tiny screw holes there</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1480.jpeg alt="Sans front, and sans screen. I was originally going to do some more mods, but then decided to leave the logic board in place. You can also see the teeny screws in the background"><figcaption><p>Sans front, and sans screen. I was originally going to do some more mods, but then decided to leave the logic board in place. You can also see the teeny screws in the background</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id=rear-casing>Rear casing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rear-casing>¶</a></h3><p>A small detail I wanted to change was the capacity written on the back. After all, it&rsquo;s not 80GB any more. Also found on eBay, I bought a new rear casing</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/camphoto_351212254.jpg alt="Spot the 1TB!"><figcaption><p>Spot the 1TB!</p></figcaption></figure><p>The issue with this is that the headphone jack and hold switch also needed transferring across. This wasn&rsquo;t too difficult in the end, though a little fiddly + I had to be very careful with the cables as they are fragile</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1482.jpeg alt="The headphone jack and hold switch, in their old back casing"><figcaption><p>The headphone jack and hold switch, in their old back casing</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id=moment-of-truth>Moment of truth<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#moment-of-truth>¶</a></h3><p>After I&rsquo;d put everything back together, I was worried it&rsquo;d not boot. Or that it would boot, but input/sound wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>Switching it on resulted in this screen:</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1487.jpeg alt="plz restore :("><figcaption><p>plz restore :(</p></figcaption></figure><p>So, I restored it on iTunes, and it worked! I followed up by installing <a href=https://rockbox.org>Rockbox</a>, and then the theme called &ldquo;<a href="https://forums.rockbox.org/index.php?topic=53574.0">FreshOS</a>&rdquo; which gives it a nice clean look (in my opinion). Rockbox has a nice installer which makes this super easy.</p><p>In addition, I no longer need to use iTunes! The iPod mounts as external storage, and the files can just be copied across. Easy.</p><p>Rockbox also means I can <a href="https://twitter.com/ellie_huxtable/status/1493172771790245890?s=20&t=C9L2RYcRdfT7aPmvmQqJmw">play doom</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/ellie_huxtable/status/1492989855101509634?s=20&t=C9L2RYcRdfT7aPmvmQqJmw">control my Macbooks volume from the iPod</a> (you know, a very useful thing to do&mldr;)</p><p>Anyway, if you have any questions please do feel free to get in touch <a href=https://twitter.com/ellie_huxtable>on Twitter</a>!</p><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1493-1.jpeg alt="The Rockbox + FreshOS home screen"><figcaption><p>The Rockbox + FreshOS home screen</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/IMG_1496.jpeg alt="With some music playing"><figcaption><p>With some music playing</p></figcaption></figure></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=next href=https://ellie.wtf/dont-forget-the-human/><span class=title>Next Page&nbsp;<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-right" style="user-select:text"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12" style="user-select:text"/><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19" style="user-select:text"/></svg></span><br><span>Don't forget the human</span></a></nav></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://ellie.wtf/>Ellie's Blog</a></span><span style=display:inline-block;margin-left:1em>
