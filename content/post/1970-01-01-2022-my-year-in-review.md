2022 has probably been one of the best years of my life, so I'd like to do my best to document everything that has happened - away from social media, and on something a little more long form! Who knows, maybe I'll be posting something similar at the end of 2023 :)

I'm starting writing this several months before the year ends, but I'd like to publish it in January 2023. Hope all is going well, future me <3

# January

January was a bit of a quiet month for me, and perhaps the only one where I didn't do much. I really struggle when it's dark outside, and January in London is very dark.

# February

* Motorcycle show, then ipod
* Snowboarding trip

# March

* Drag racing
* Flew to the US at the end of the month
