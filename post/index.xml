      <title>2022, my year in review</title>

      <description>2022 has probably been one of the best years of my life, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to do my best to document everything that has happened - away from social media, and on something a little longer form! Who knows, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting something similar at the end of 2023. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this not so much for other people to read, but moreso for me to remember.
I try to take the possibility that every day could be my last pretty seriously, and I&amp;rsquo;m really happy that I can look back on this year and feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve made the most of it.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t forget the human</title>

      <description>Computers are cold and heartless. They don&amp;rsquo;t lie, and they don&amp;rsquo;t care if you scream and swear at them. You can abuse them all day long, and they&amp;rsquo;ll still efficiently flip bits and push pixels.
But&amp;hellip; people aren&amp;rsquo;t. Behind every piece of software, there&amp;rsquo;s at least one human. Who has a heart, and who cares what you think. Who has hopes, and dreams, and fears. Who feels.
This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to write in one form or another for quite a while now, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been rewriting this post for a little too long.</description>

      <title>Geospatial queries with MongoDB</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently playing with MongoDB and its geospatial queries. It’s pretty interesting so far, so I just thought I&amp;rsquo;d write something up to show how I&amp;rsquo;m using it with PyMongo!
Firstly, the obvious pip install pymongo is needed. We will need a mongo client first, which is easy enough
from pymongo import MongoClient client = MongoClient() It’s pretty neat - by default, MongoClient will connect to mongodb://localhost:27017.
You might want to do something like this instead though</description>
